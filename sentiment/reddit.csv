Transitioning to Mid-Large SUV from 2014 Mercedes e350 Wagon,"Hello Friends. Longtime reader. My first post.

We are looking to trade-in our family car (e350 Wagon) for a Mid to Large SUV. What's driving the change:

* we recently moved and our driveway has a steeper grade that the wagon is bottoming out on
* my wife prefers the higher view of the SUV
* I'm sick of replacing the low profile tires
* The current wagon software + tech is dated
* Wagon is off warranty. Everything on e350 is expensive to maintain (car is worth btw 15-20k but replacing the hydraulic brake lines would be 3k+)

I thought about getting the new GLE or X7 but ultimately I would rather spend <$50k and not stress when the SUV gets worn down by my family. I have only bought 1 new car in my life (Tesla Model 3) - everything else I have acquired used (current other car is a '95 911 4s). Open to new or used and leasing vs buying. Let me know where you see the value!

How would you rank (1 being best): Cx9, Telluride, Palisade, XC90, \[ what other options?\]

Very anecdotally it seems like the German SUVs are somewhat dated and the software operating systems + features are somewhat behind the upstarts (Kia, Hyundai etc).

The kid in me (I'm turning 40) would love to get a 90s defender, Scout etc but I'm trying to keep this search as practical as possible (and execute this weekend). So I care more about parking sensors + cameras, charging capabilities etc.

Thanks!!! Looking forward to everyone's input",whatcarshouldIbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/jgzv6y/transitioning_to_midlarge_suv_from_2014_mercedes/,1603530364.0

 All my door handles were presenting but the rear passenger side wasn’t opening. After a few quick searches I learned that it’s because the original connections tend to break easily from the motion of the handle moving out. I think Tesla charges >$350 for the repair and I found the part for $79 online. So I researched how to replace it myself; read through and watched several guides for which I’m very thankful for. All went pretty much according to plan; I knew I would struggle with getting the plastic clips off and I knew getting the the four bolts would be tough. But what I didn’t plan for was how to get the handle back in with the car unlocked and the window up with the door open. The handle needs to be retracted before you can wiggle it out of the door frame. I had to close the door and lock the car while I was inside after I removed the panel then I could detach the pigtail to the handle so it wouldn’t present when I opened the door again. Also when the door is opened the window is down slightly, obstructing the two top bolts. So again I shut the door and crawled inside the car to remove those. The other thing I didn’t count on was that the pigtail was clipped around the frame with plastic zip ties anchored to the door frame. I ended up just cutting those and then replacing them with my own. The actual repair to the handle itself was simple and fast. The new pigtail part has extended rubber over the wire to prevent it from breaking and the wire comes out of the top where there is more room for it to flex when the handle moves. I purchased the pigtail off Amazon from a third party. I was very pleased with their design changes. Overall, disassembly took me much longer than I hoped and was very physically demanding. Having the right tools such as long drivers to get into the tight spots is very necessary. In retrospect I think it was probably worth it to take it to Tesla to have them do it. If anyone is planning on taking on this task themselves and wants to know more please feel free to PM me.",TeslaMotorsArchive,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaMotorsArchive/comments/jgz8gr/archive_replaced_model_s_door_handle_micro_switch/,1603527875.0
