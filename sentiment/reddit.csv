"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, October 27, 2020. Please enjoy!","**PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, October 27, 2020**

Stocks traded choppily after yesterday’s selloff, with the indices losing an average of 5% from their October highs. Market participants are closely monitoring the rising number of coronavirus cases in the US and Europe and uncertainty surrounding stimulus and the presidential election a mere week away.

In the US, over the weekend, the US registered coronavirus cases hit a record high with more than 81,000 new cases, according to data gathered from worldometers.info. Yesterday, the US registered 70,000 new cases. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert said the US is still in the “first wave” of the pandemic, given that cases never stabilized to more than a “manageable level.” He explained that while the Northeast has been able to reduce its outbreak, the national baseline never fell to a more manageable number like 10,000 cases per day.

With a worrying surge of cases across Europe, governments have begun imposing a new round of restrictions. Today, the Czech Republic joined France, Spain, Italy, and the United Kingdom in enforcing a strict nighttime curfew and placing new restrictions in businesses such as gyms and restaurants. 

Yesterday, Speaker Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin met for what feels like the hundredth time to discuss the passage of additional stimulus. Pelosi’s spokesperson Drew Hamill said of the meeting, “The Speaker remains optimistic that an agreement can be reached before the election,” adding that “progress depends on Leader Mitch McConnell.” Today, Senators left Washington for a break ahead of the election. With the election a mere week away and Senators no longer in Washington, chances to pass a bill are extremely thin. 

Next Tuesday, November 3rd are the US presidential elections between Joe Biden (D) and President Trump (R). The election is set to be extremely contentious and will have enormous effect on the market for years to come.
