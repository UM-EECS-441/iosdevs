+$415.21 Day Trading Small Cap Stocks,"First three days of the week things went well overall. Misplayed EVK on Thursday. On Friday I had an accuracy of 8/9 trades winning, but the one trade I lost I was pretty upset with myself so I walked away. Swing trade on Tesla will be between $70-100 profit which I'll be selling Monday.

"Swaggy Weekend Sentiment Report - October 25, 2020","Let’s take a look at what stocks were trending last week going into the weekend and what to keep an eye on for this trading week. Some of the tickers that were trending and included in this report are: SNAP, TSLA, AAPL, AMD, GME, INTC, FDX/UPS

[PDF Download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15EugbkskwgnhGt1ErQURRJ4FrFQh8wEp/view?usp=sharing)

# SNAP - Snapchat

https://preview.redd.it/s9xi67gffcv51.png?width=1710&format=png&auto=webp&s=75d56e4caa44110662d4b03f63ee9a37149251a6

SNAP reached peak WallStreetBets sentiment and has been the sentiment leader since earnings on Thursday. The stock popped the FK off up 30% after earnings and momentum continued up another 8% into Friday's session while WSB-ers couldn't believe this meteoric rise. Many users were “jacked to the tits” in PUTS expecting the stock to give back some of it's returns. Will the stock see a reversal to the downside? We’ll find out this week, but I haven’t seen the sub-reddit this bearish on a ticker since NKLA.

&#x200B;

# TSLA - Tesla 

https://preview.redd.it/nfd53bsgfcv51.png?width=1708&format=png&auto=webp&s=c75f7484815a9e185f04978c58a66abd137f87d7

TSLA will always be WallStreetBets' baby. TSLA reported earnings on Wednesday and many WSBers were expecting YUGE movements to the upside. Somewhere in the distance a mumble is heard  ""TSLA's been trading at $420 for too long"" followed by ""It was supposed to go up"". Tesla reported great earnings, but the stock surprised investors by actually not doing much. Since it's split TSLA hasn't seen many more gamma squeeze's like it used to. Is the new volume/float of shares preventing this? Was the split the right move? In Elon we trust.

&#x200B;

# AAPL - Apple Inc 

https://preview.redd.it/o3dn9pehfcv51.png?width=1712&format=png&auto=webp&s=0a4abdc3d655a7abc70fd7ec94b84dd19f61ce49

AAPL only goes up, right? It seems the stock price hasn't done much of “going up” in the last 6 weeks and WSB is continuing to lose money on call options. ""What is Tim Apple even doing"" a WSB user says. ""2 trillion dollar company and the stock only goes down"" another user says in frustration.

&#x200B;

# AMD - Advanced Micro Devices 

https://preview.redd.it/we7i4fuhfcv51.png?width=1736&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e18b27fbc76dc821796d8b461f53b17be1ffc2c

WallStreetBets was expecting Su Bae to deliver two weeks ago with their Zen 3 and Radeon presentation. AMD is currently down 6% since and dipped into the high $70's in Friday's session before a reversal to the upside. Will AMD deliver on their earnings report on Tuesday after the bell? WSB seems to think so as they are 85% BULLISH on the stock.

# GME - Gamestop 

https://preview.redd.it/8u53l9cifcv51.png?width=1714&format=png&auto=webp&s=b56bf8f3b6e1c1f365bc1c250fec28ef5eca3920

Gamestop has only recently become a meme stock on WallStreetBets. We have users pumping short interest ideas, (check out [Swaggy's version](https://www.swaggystocks.com/dashboard/stocks/due-diligence/research/9/2020-09-25/GME) here), and other users loading the truck on shares and calls getting ready for the main event, the SHORT SQUEEZE is coming, as they say.

&#x200B;

# INTC - Intel 

https://preview.redd.it/n47txfrifcv51.png?width=1708&format=png&auto=webp&s=afcbeed1fd1bbd2c9178e0f7212465ea3b4ec526

Many WallStreetBets users are LONG INTC based on the reasoning of being a ""value"" stock. ""Surely the stock can't drop anymore"" a WSB member says. Recently someone YOLO'd on INTC LEAPs and was up $30k on the position pre-earnings. One user noted ""Holy fuck there was a guy here 3 days ago that was up $30,000 on INTC leaps... I went back to check on him and his account or comments were deleted. RIP"" Ouch, that's tough... but sometimes WSB finds comfort in another man's (or woman's) mis-fortune. A WSBer commented on the event ""LMFAO. Sadly this gave me a laugh”.

&#x200B;

# FDX & UPS - Parcel Services  

https://preview.redd.it/yv3ocsgjfcv51.png?width=1720&format=png&auto=webp&s=47a041c6b01251446e0ec7de34e06d7a6d8a690b

https://preview.redd.it/fl71w5tjfcv51.png?width=1718&format=png&auto=webp&s=f8282b105eec77637f0e7b84a6631e4952c2f751

An honorable mention that WSB is very bullish on parcel delivery services Fedex (FDX) and UPS. Could this be the WSB indicator and the time to get the fuck out of the stock? Only time will tell.",SwaggyStocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/SwaggyStocks/comments/ji5r8g/swaggy_weekend_sentiment_report_october_25_2020/,1603705179.0

Tesla Model S performance or BMW M3,"I used to own a Subaru WRX. Looking to get a new car, I need four doors and for it to be fun to drive. I love manual transmission cars so I preordered a 2021 M3 fully loaded. The problem is I have to wait until March to get the car and I am getting impatient. I don’t need the car right now but would be cool to have as I haven’t driven much during lockdowns. 

The model s performance is about the same price has four doors and all wheel drive for when I go to the snow occasionally. It’s quicker and more environmentally friendly and has cutting edge technology like the full self driving beta currently. 

BMW M3:
- Enthusiasts car
- Manual transmission
- Will be able to track the car 
- Interior is a lot nicer 
- Better overall build quality 
- Depreciation can be huge
- Rear wheel drive only for manual transmission
- Have to wait until March

Tesla Model S Performance:
- New technology
- Really fast acceleration
- Awd for the occasional snow
- Available to buy today 
- I think it retains value better than the m3
- A lot of build quality issues 
- Not really a drivers car 
- Manual transmissions are a dying breed
- Hard to charge in apartment buildings

The only time I would consider an automatic is if it’s as cutting edge as the Tesla. Otherwise I’m sticking with 3 pedals for traditional cars",whatcarshouldIbuy,https://www.reddit.com/r/whatcarshouldIbuy/comments/ji59jl/tesla_model_s_performance_or_bmw_m3/,1603703256.0

Would consider 1:1 for the legacy items if its an AA, Q, V, or TS E/25 with a 25 prefix for the 3rd. The Heavy Weapons I am looking for are either E/FR or 25/FR, but possibly with 90 as well.

Looking for anything of equal trade value, but I prefer handmades, fixers, and other heavies, especially a VEFR or 90 .50 cal. Mostly looking for AAE/25, VE/25 and QE/25 Fixers and Handmades. Only looking for top prefix combos tho. Either E/25 and something vats related, preferably 25. 

Please, no +1A or P for the Fixers and Handmades, and not looking for Bashing or Movement Speed either. Would also consider other legacy weapons. Thank you.",Market76,https://www.reddit.com/r/Market76/comments/ji5dpy/ps4h_tse_gatling_plasma_befr_and_b25fr_miniguns/,1603703702.0

Exactly in the title . . . Is there a place where someone tracks what superchargers Tesla planned to open vs what actually opened?  I know about supercharge.info. But it doesn’t really track planned chargers. Or at least I cannot find the info.  I am just curious how many planned superchargers were built/started and which ones weren’t. Or even which ones happened that were not planned.",TeslaLounge,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeslaLounge/comments/ji5n7l/is_there_a_place_where_someone_tracks_what/,1603704742.0
